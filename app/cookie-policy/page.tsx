            <h2>What Are Cookies</h2>
            <p>
              Cookies are small text files that are placed on your computer or mobile device when you visit a website.
              They are widely used to make websites work more efficiently and provide information to the owners of the
              site. Cookies enhance user experience by allowing websites to remember your preferences and understand how
              you use different parts of our website.
            </p>

            <h2>How We Use Cookies</h2>
            <p>SparkVibe Digital uses cookies for a variety of purposes, including:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Essential Cookies:</strong> These cookies are necessary for the website to function properly.
                They enable core functionality such as security, network management, and account access. You may disable
                these by changing your browser settings, but this may affect how the website functions.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Analytics Cookies:</strong> We use analytics cookies to collect information about how visitors
                use our website. This helps us improve our website by understanding how visitors interact with it. These
                cookies collect information in an anonymous form, including the number of visitors to the website, where
                visitors have come from, and the pages they visited.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Functionality Cookies:</strong> These cookies allow the website to remember choices you make
                (such as your username, language, or the region you are in) and provide enhanced, more personal
                features. The information these cookies collect may be anonymized and they cannot track your browsing
                activity on other websites.
              </li>

                <strong>Marketing Cookies:</strong> These cookies are used to track visitors across websites. The
                intention is to display ads that are relevant and engaging for the individual user and thereby more
